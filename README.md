# Timesheet App (React Native)

## Project Overview

This is a React Native mobile application for timesheet management, designed for teams to track working hours, manage tasks, and generate reports. The app supports different user roles with role-specific interfaces.

## Project Structure

The app follows a role-based architecture, separating screens by user roles:
- **Team Member**: Regular employees who log their time and view assigned tasks
- **Team Leader**: Managers who oversee team activities and approve timesheets
- **Common**: Screens accessible to all users regardless of role

## Running the App in Android Studio Emulator

To run the app in Android Studio emulator using cmd:

1. Navigate to the app directory:
```
cd C:\timesheet-app-rn
```

2. Start the Metro bundler:
```
npx react-native start --port=8088
```

3. In a new terminal window, run the app on Android emulator:
```
npx react-native run-android --port=8088
```

Note: Port 8088 is used to avoid conflicts with other services.
